# CS224 Computer Organization Labs

This repository contains lab assignments and projects for **CS224: Computer Organization**.  
The labs cover topics such as MIPS assembly programming, processor datapaths, control logic, and memory systems.  
Some labs are implemented in **MIPS assembly**, while others use **SystemVerilog** to model and simulate processor architecture.
